        <p> </p>
        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            As you know my name is Pablo and I am studying computer engineer or informatics, you can call 
            it as you want, that is up to you. What I like the most is programming, specifically programming 
            videogames.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            By now I know 2 lenguages of programming C++ and C#, well and a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
            this three last lenguages are the ones that I use to make this CV in web style (hope you like it).
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            In relation to studies, here are mine. Firstly, I have completed high school. Currently, I am studying 
            computer engineering. As for additional courses beyond the usual ones that everyone has, which are the 
            ones we have already seen so far, I have a level 1 sports technician certification in surfing and a 
            title certifying that I am an EXPERT IN 3D STUDIO MAX MOTIONBUILDER, MUDBOX, VIDEO EDITING, AND 
            POST-PRODUCTION by Espai Barcelona School.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok and talking of jobs I have had so far, I have worked in different places: 
        </p>
        <p><b>1_</b> Guide at the Science Museum of Barcelona, "Cosmo Caixa".</p>
        <p><b>2_</b> Surf instructor, in many surf schools.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            I had been working as guide for half a year and as a surf instructor since 2022. To be honest, I 
            really like those jobs but I am ambitious and I want more, so I am looking for another job that helps 
            me evolve and achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            Regarding my skills and qualities that may interest you, I am good at working in a team, and 
            furthermore, I am a very sociable person with an ease for public speaking and making friends 
            (thanks to my work as a surf instructor). I also speak english, spanish and catalan.
