        <h1>Pablo de Vicente-Tutor Moegle</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
        <p>
            As you know my name is Pablo and I am studying computer engineer or informatics, you can call 
            it as you want, that is up to you. What I like the most is programming, specifically programming 
            videogames.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now I know 2 lenguages of programming C++ and C#, well and a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
            this three last lenguages are the ones that I use to make this CV in web style (hope you like it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok, talking of jobs I have had so far, I have worked in different places. My first job was as a guide 
            at the Science Museum of Barcelona, "Cosmo Caixa." After this job, I moved on to teaching surfing, 
            a sport I have been practicing since I was a child and that I love the most. As a surf instructor, I 
            have been working since 2022 and I am still working. (To be honest, I really like this job but I am 
            ambitious and I want more, so I am looking for another job that helps me evolve and achieve my goals).
