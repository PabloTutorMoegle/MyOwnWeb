        <p> </p>
        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            As you know my name is Pablo and I am studying computer engineer or informatics, you can call 
            it as you want, that is up to you. What I like the most is programming, specifically programming 
            videogames.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            By now I know 2 lenguages of programming C++ and C#, well and a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
            this three last lenguages are the ones that I use to make this CV in web style (hope you like it).

            Ok, talking of jobs I have had so far, I have worked in different places: 
        </p>
        <p><a>1_</a> Guide at the Science Museum of Barcelona, "Cosmo Caixa".</p>
        <p><a>2_</a> Surf instructor, in many surf schools.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            I had been working as guide for half a year and as a surf instructor since 2022. To be honest, I 
            really like those jobs but I am ambitious and I want more, so I am looking for another job that helps 
            me evolve and achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            Regarding my skills and qualities that may interest you, I am good at working in a team, and 
            furthermore, I am a very sociable person with an ease for public speaking and making friends 
            (thanks to my work as a surf instructor). I also speak english, spanish and catalan.
